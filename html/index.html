    <p1>Hello! My name is Julian Murillo, I am a 16 year old kid who goes to Davinci Connect Highschool in El Segundo. I live in Torrance and Inglewood with both of my families (alternating), and I have 2 dogs and 3 cats.</p1>
    <p1>In the future, I would look to become a molecular biologist? Or maybe become a bioengineer, something that has to do with life.</p1>
    <p1>Some of my hobbies and interests include gaming competitively, practicing Jujitsu at my "Golden State" gym, and reading comic books in my spare time.</p1>
